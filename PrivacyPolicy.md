## Data
Clarity Card does not require an account or sign-in, and we do not collect, store, or share personal data. All calculations, quiz responses, and interactions happen locally on your device, and no app data is sent to external servers. The app does not use third-party analytics, advertising trackers, or remote databases. In short, your usage stays on your device.
